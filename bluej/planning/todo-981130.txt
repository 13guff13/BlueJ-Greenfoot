New Functionality needed:

  * support for applets
  * support for standalone applications
  - compiler warnings
  ? support for beans
  ? support for javadoc

Things left to be done:

  - inspection: public / private
  - graphical editing updating text
  - library browsing / semantics of multiple windows
    -> imported classes and packages
  - properties: need dialog for editing
  - printing

Ideas:

  - classes should talk more directly to the editor interface
  - close of last window should close package and return to inital state
    -> if only one window is open, close should be disabled
  - quit should warn if there are multiple windows open
  - drag and drop between object benches of different packages

Notes:

  - we will change to using Swing for everything

Design decisions:

  * Arrow operations
                                    graphically         textually
           / inheritance arrow        known               done*
     insert
           \ uses arrow              see below            done*

           / inheritance arrow        known             see below
     delete
           \ uses arrow              see below          see below
