Changes made in version 0.8.5:

	- allow selection of objects during method calls

	- construct scope when calling methods
	
	- collect javadoc-style comments into per-class files (.ctxt files)
	
	- update method invocation and menus to display the source information
		(e.g. variable names in methods, comments, etc.)
	
	- debugging
	
	- update the views code to load the comments on-demand
	
	- write View code to generate (filtered) class views via a 
	  FormattedPrintFilter
	
	- convert all GUI code to use Swing

	- new class dialog enter/return in text field equals okay.  Initial 
	  focus in text field.

	- clear the parameter field in object call dialogue before next call

	- "create" dialog - focus should be in parameter field 
	   (or in name field if no params). 

	- type names in Views now show only class name, not full package name.

	- in inspection dialog "Get" and "Inspect" buttons must be
	  greyed out when not applicable.

	- in inspection dialog show class name of object, show
	  access modifier of fields.

	- runtime code
		* redirect System.{in, out}
		* override exit() calls

	- inspection: public / private

	- editor has been replaced by a new editor (moe) using swing components

	- compile, save, reload implemented in editor

	- main window status bar:
		- cleared periodically
		- compile shown
		- creation shown

	- fixed create uses/extends switch bug

	- added rubberband display for arrow insertion w/o dragging

	- re-arranged package window menu items

	- package compile operation saves classes first, if changed

	- compiler notifies editor of successful compilation

	- editor improvements

	- open "Not Yet Implemented" dialogue for all NYI function
	  (don't use console output)

	- package selection dialog - open/double click should both open 
	  directories, open package (double click must be same as "Open" 
	  button)

	- result of type "string" is shown incorrectly (should show string 
	  literal)

	- package window: toolbar buttons should never have focus
	  (keyboard will later be used to operate on classes, not toolbar)

	- execution with parameter does not work

	- graphical edits (arrow addition/removal) must set class state to
	  "not compiled"

	- after compile, force graph redraw to display new arrows

	- implement "save" menu item

	- save/restore window size

	- removal of arrows (highlight on mouseover, etc.)

	- result dialogue should not use "toString" function 
		(object should be shown as <object>).

	- package selection - selection of invalid directory throws exception 
		but canvas changes from greyed out to white (looks like empty
		project).

	- check/complete/reorganise main window menu items

	- abstract class shows constructor (but shouldn't)

	- added setting/deleting/display of breakpoints to editor

	- checked new class names for valid identifiers

	- object creation generates exceptions

	- write tutorial

	- terminal window bugs fixed
