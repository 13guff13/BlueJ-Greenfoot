Instructions on compiling and running JavaBlue from source.

After obtaining a complete source tree (either from the CVS repository or
by other means), do the following to build JavaBlue:

On a Unix machine (with Bourne shell and GNU make):

	add the directory javablue/bin to your PATH

	export OS=unix
	make dep
	make

On Windows, you will need the Cygnus GNU-Win32 tools, version b19 with
the updated version of cygwinb19.dll or later. Then create a /bin and
a /tmp directory, and do:

	cd /bin
	ln -s /cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/bin/bash.exe* sh

substituting the path for the bash executable on your system in the above

To build JavaBlue, you then do:

	add the directory javablue/bin to your PATH

	export OS=win32
	make dep
	make

Expect some error messages when you run "make dep", but the
make itself should complete successfully. Then you should be
able to run JavaBlue by typing

	bin/javablue
