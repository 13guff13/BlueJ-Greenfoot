# Installer properties
# This properties-style file completely defines what the installer should do.
#
# Some special characters can be used in commands and paths:
#  ~ (tilde) will be replaced by the installation directory
#  ! (exclamation) will be replaced the Java home directory
#  @ (at) will be replaced by the processor architecture name 
#        (eg. i386, sparc, ...)
