How to build the BlueJ/Greenfoot launcher (and installer)
---------------------------------------------------------

The launcher is built using the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) environment:

http://www.mingw.org/

See MINGW.TXT for information on required packages and setup.

Step 1.
-------

Edit the bjlaunch.rc file and correct the version numbers. This needs to be done
in two places. Make sure to change the information (protected by #ifdef) for the
correct product, either BlueJ or Greenfoot.

Example settings to look for:

  FILEVERSION 1,5,1,0
  PRODUCTVERSION 1,5,1,0

            VALUE "FileVersion", "1.5.1"
            VALUE "InternalName", "greenfoot"
            VALUE "OriginalFilename", "greenfoot.exe"
            VALUE "ProductName", "Greenfoot"
            VALUE "ProductVersion", "1.5.1"

*** Also *** edit the appropriate manifest file - either bjmanifest.xml or
gfmanifest.xml - and update the version there. It should be a four digit
version, eg "3.0.4.0" for version 3.0.4, the last digit can be used as a
build ID or just left at 0.
