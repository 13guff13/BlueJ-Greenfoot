 **
 ** The class messages handles the display of all message dialog boxes.  These
 ** include error and help dialogs.  Help dialogs are non-modal dialogs
 ** consisting of a message and an OK button.  Error dialogs are modal dialogs
 ** consisting of a message, an OK and a Help button.  Every error message has
 ** an associated help message.
 ** 
 ** Messages are displayed by calling the show_help or show_error routine with
 ** the appropriate message number.  This class defines all the actual message
 ** texts and performs the transformation from number to text.  Every error
 ** message and its associated help message have the same number.  So all the
 ** help messages up to NR_ERROR are help messages for error dialogs.
