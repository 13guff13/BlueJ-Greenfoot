 ';' expected
There is a semicolon missing at the end of 
a line. This could be the line marked in the
editor, or the line above.

 String not terminated at end of line
You have a string (with double quotes, like "this")
in your program that starts in this line but does
not end in the same line. Strings cannot span
multiple lines. You either forgot the quotes at
the end of the string, or you put them on another 
line.
