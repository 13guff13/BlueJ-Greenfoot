For demonstration on 7/8/98 (two weeks away):

* correct display of ==> arrows (fix trig)
	--> done

* spacing and colour of components and targets
	--> done (colour is now configurable)

* new behaviour:
	- "Package" menu renamed something ("tools"? "operations"? "commands"?)
	- File menu renamed "Package"
	- Package window starts empty - nothing there, greyed out
	- "New" command prompts for directory
	- "New" and "Open" will open into current window if empty (grey), but will open a new window if there is already a package open
	- "Close" always closes the window - never just close the package.
		--> done

	- [window menu - list of currently open windows + other stuff]

* skeleton code when classes created
	--> done

* [update code when arrows drawn / deleted]

* compiler:
	- error messages - filter warnings, [set cursor position]

	- correct display during and after compilation (fix compiler error case)
		--> done

* menu on classes (static methods, class operations, etc.)
	--> done

* menu on objects:
	- move Object methods to submenu
		--> done

* class creation == method calling:
	- parameter passing
		--> done (needs new GUI code to be called).

	- result display
		--> done (sort of)

* [inspection of objects]

* editing (Red):
	- show compile errors correctly
		--> done

	- [update graphical representation]

	- fix Red bugs so that simple editing is possible (move cursor and make changes)
		--> done

	- notify package window about changes to classes
		--> done

* [runtime:
	- Terminal I/O
	- System.exit()
