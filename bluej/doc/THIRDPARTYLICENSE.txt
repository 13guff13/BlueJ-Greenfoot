The Reflections code in org.reflections was taken from the Reflections library by ronamo,
master version from https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections on 2014-05-30, after commit
662061c7544a6fb4155dbfa8b95d4d5c7a372806.  The code was originally licensed under the WTFPL,
which allows us to relicence it as GPLv2 with Classpath exception.
