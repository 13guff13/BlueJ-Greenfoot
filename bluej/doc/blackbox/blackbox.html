<span class="question-heading" id="what_data">What data will be sent?</span>




<span class="question-heading" id="who">Who will the data be sent to?</span>

<div class="answer">
The data will be sent to a server hosted at the University of Kent in the UK.
Researchers at the University of Kent will have access to the data in order to
analyse it, and access will also be provided to other recognised computing
education researchers for the purpose of analysis.
</div>


<span class="question-heading" id="anon">How will the data be anonymised?</span>

<div class="answer">
No identifying information (e.g. username, machine name) is sent to the
server.  The name of the project is sent, but the full path (which probably
contains your username) is not.  Source code is sent, but all comments before
the class begins are blanked out -- that is, the top comment before your class
will be blanked, as that typically contains your name.  All other code (and
comments) are sent to the server.
</div>


<span class="question-heading" id="opt_in_out">How can I opt in/out?</span>

<div class="answer">
To change your participation in this research, in BlueJ 3.1.0 and later, go to
the Preferences window, and under the Miscellaneous tab there is an option to
change your current participation.
</div>


<span class="question-heading" id="repeated">Why do I repeatedly get asked if
  I want to opt in?</span>

<div class="answer">
<p>
Your participation status is stored in BlueJ's properties file.  This is
stored in your user profile directory on your machine.  For a home machine, or
a school network which supports persistent profiles, you should be asked once,
and this decision stored thereafter.
</p>

<p>However if your network does not keep your profile, you will be asked every
  time you load BlueJ, because BlueJ cannot tell that you have been asked
  before.  In this case, you will need to contact your network administrator
  and tell them to either let profiles persist (the ideal solution), or
  otherwise to alter the bluej.defs file supplied with BlueJ to include the
  line:</p>
