Prerequisites:
 build.properties in both the greenfoot and bluej source directories should be 
 modified to match your configuration.


Building Greenfoot:
 1. Update version number in build.xml and run "ant update-version-number".
 2. Update greenfoot-about.png and greenfoot-splash.jpg with new version number.
 3. Test bundled scenarios and make sure they are upgraded to new API version.
 4. Run "ant ready-to-run" in the BlueJ directory.
 5. Run "ant dist" in the Greenfoot directory
 6. Copy the builds and source to greenfoot.org.
 7. Make someone build the windows installer.
 
If necessary:
 8. If the API version has changed, copy Greenfoot-core-X.X.X-jar to the gallery: /home/mygame/mygame/public/sharedjars/
 9. If any of the 3rd party libraries have changed copy them to: /home/mygame/mygame/public/sharedjars/
10. If the licenses have changed, copy LICENSE.txt and/or THIRDPARTYLICENSE.txt to: www.greenfoot.org/about.
