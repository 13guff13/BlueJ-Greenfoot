To start:
    Press compile and a new world will be created for you.
    Press play to start playing.
    
The aim of the game is to reveal the location of all the Greenfoots (bombs)
by clearing all the non-Greenfoot tiles.
    
To play:
    Press on the blocks to reveal what is underneath.
    If there is a Greenfoot underneath, you lose.
    If there is a number, it describes how many Greenfoots are bording this block.
    If there it nothing, nothing is bordering this block.
    If you reveal all the non-Greenfoot tiles, you win.
    
Options:
    The world width, height and number of mines can be changed by altering
    the WIDTH, HEIGHT and MINES variables in the MineSweeper world class.
    
Enjoy!
