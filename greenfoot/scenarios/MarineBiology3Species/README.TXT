VERSION or DATE:
1.0

AUTHORS:
Adapted by C.Vargas, P.Henriksen, and M.Kolling from the original
College Board case study.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
To add more fish, select one of the fish classes and then hold Shift
as you click on the grid cells. Or you can invoke one of the populate
methods from the World object. Right-click the label BoundedEnv above the
grid to get the list of methods for this object.
You can create worlds of different sizes by right-clicking the BoundedEnv
