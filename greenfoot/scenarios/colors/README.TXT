PROJECT TITLE: 
The working title is Colors

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
The purpose of this project is to be used for a greenfoot competition 
to get teachers interested in greenfoot. The competition will be held at
the next SIGCSE conference. 
To do this the scenario needs to fulfill several requirements:
 1) It has to be interesting to look in order to get attention from people that
    walks by.
 2) It has to be easy to submit a solution that does something better than the 
    default solution (if any exists).
 3) It must be possible to create better solutions by investing more time in 
    competition. 
 4) There must NOT be a perfect obvious solution.

Try to improve the behaviour of pirate so that it is faster at collection

DEVELOPMENT NOTES:

** What should be allowed to do in each act? **
One movement. Is a turn a movement?
Should we attempt to make sure that this rule is not violated through some checks
 in the Agent?

** How far can pirates see? **
Can pirates look beyond where they are currently located?
