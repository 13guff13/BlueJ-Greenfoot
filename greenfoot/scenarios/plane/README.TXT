PROJECT TITLE:
Plane

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
A very simple example demonstrating input via object interaction: a control knob
can be dragged sideways on screen to control an airplane.

Not a complete simulation or game, just a small demonstration to present some
ideas for possible scenario creation. 

VERSION or DATE:
1.0

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
Instantiate a Plane and put it in the world. Press the Run button.

AUTHORS:
Michael Kolling

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Once the plane has been added to the world, a control knob will appear which
you can use to control the direction of the plane. Drag the knob around and
the plane will turn as it flies.
