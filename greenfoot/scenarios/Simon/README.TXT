This is a Greenfoot version of the classic Simon game.
To play simply compile the project and then press play.

A color will light up randomly, you must then press
the corresponding color. Then 2 colors will light in order,
and you must press those colors in the same order.
The order of colors then extends, until you enter the wrong color.

The four colors correspond to numbered keys.
    Green - 1
    Red - 2
    Yellow - 3
    Blue - 4
