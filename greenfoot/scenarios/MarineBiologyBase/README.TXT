PROJECT TITLE:
Marine Biology Simulation

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This is the bounded-world Marine Biology Simulation Case Study for the
College Board AP Exam. It simulates fish in a bounded environment, as
described in the first two chapters of the narrative for the case study.
That is, the fish do not breed or die.
 
VERSION or DATE:
1.0

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
Compile all the classes and hit the Run button.

AUTHORS:
Adapted by C.Vargas, P.Henriksen, and M.Kolling from the original
College Board case study.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
To add more fish, select the Fish class and then hold Shift as you click on
the grid cells.
To place fish all along the boundary of the world, call the method 
populateBoundaryFish() from the World object. Right-click the label
BoundedEnv above the grid to get a list of methods in this object.
You can create worlds of different sizes by right-clicking the BoundedEnv
class and invoking the constructor with two arguments.
