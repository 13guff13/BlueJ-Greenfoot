PROJECT TITLE:
Marine Biology Simulation purely in Greenfoot.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This looks like the bounded-world Marine Biology Simulation Case Study.
It simulates fish in a bounded environment.
 
VERSION or DATE:
1.0

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
Compile all the classes and hit the Run button.

AUTHORS:
Adapted by Cecilia Vargas from the original College Board case study to run in Greenfoot. 
That is, the code from the original study was changed considerably, although the fish's
behavior is still the same.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
To add more fish, select the Fish class and then hold Shift as you click on
the grid cells, or invoke the populate method on the World object.
